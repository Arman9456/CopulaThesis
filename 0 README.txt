The 6 main files, numbered 1 till 6 are the files containing the code for my MSc thesis.
The files numbered 1 till 5 correspond to section 3 of the thesis, whereas the 6th file corresponds to section 4 of the thesis.

The files that make the functions for apply the OLS,IV,GC and IVCOP are:
"2 Functions.R" and "3 IntceptFunctions.R", the former looking at the equations without intercept and the latter at equations with intercept.

The files that construct the different simulation scenarios are: 
"4 Simulations.R" and "5 IntceptSimulations.R", the former looking at the simulations without intercept and the latter at simulations with intercept.

The file "Main Code.R" runs all the different simulation scenario's.

The file "6 Empirical.R" contains the code for the empirical application of section 4.
